dugroup(1) is a program that takes the output of the Unix utility du(1) and,
for each directory containing listed files, collects certain classes of files
(such as backup files or images) together into groups.  For each group of
files, dugroup(1) outputs its collective disk space utilization as a fake
subdirectory, and also lists its constituent files individually under that
fake subdirectory.

dugroup(1) is typically executed as the middle of a pipeline between du(1)
[typically invoked with the -a option] and a disk space utilization display
program such as xdu(1) or tdu(1).
