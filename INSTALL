Requirements to install dugroup:

	- GNU Make

To install the above on a Debian GNU/Linux system:

	apt-get install make

What you need to do:

	1. type: make
	2. type: make install

What the above steps do:

	make
	- generates the dugroup manpage.
	make install
	- installs the executable as /usr/local/bin/dugroup
	- installs the manpage as /usr/local/man/man1/dugroup.1

If you do not wish to install into /usr/local, then instead of a simple "make
install" you can install to a different installation path via one of the
following:

	make install prefix=/usr

	# if you have the GNU Stow package installed
	make install prefix=/usr/local/stow/dugroup
	cd /usr/local/stow
	stow dugroup
